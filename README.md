# web-scrape-game

Simple scrape of a website selling books. I extracted the title, rating and price from all of the books. 

I used Python with Beautiful Soup and then created a CSV file with all of the information.

Finally, using the CSV file, I created a small game where the user can guess which book has a higher rating and then based on the answer, which one has a higher price.
